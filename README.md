## Chess with video

This is a backend for application that should enable to play chess and have a video chat with your opponent at the same time.

Next tasks:

- UI: allow rotation of the board
- think about handling concurrency (e.g. one player does a move, while another resets board)
- simplify UI of video
- enable multiple games/videos at the same time (e.g. keep lists of channels together)
