## Chess with video

This is a backend for application that should enable to play chess and have a video chat with your opponent at the same time.

Next tasks:

- think about handling concurrency (e.g. one player does a move, while another resets board)
- enable multiple games/videos at the same time (e.g. keep lists of channels together)

## Development

To start locally run `main` in `Server.kt`.

To deploy use `git push heroku master`.
