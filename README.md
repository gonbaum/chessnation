## Chess with video

This is a backend for application that should enable to play chess and have a video chat with your opponent at the same time.

It connects to lichess to keep the game running there (this dependency could be dropped).

Next tasks:

- create UI (e.g. https://github.com/ornicar/chessground)
- start working on integrating video
